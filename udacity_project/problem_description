Bogot√° Athens of America is a cosmopolitan that has been characterized by rapid economic growth in recent years. As its population has grown rapidly and has become necessary to create city blocks of many buildings for households of people, where some processes of daily life are complicated. In our study we found that one of the things that bother people is that there is very little space. Drying your clothes is difficult and washing big things as carpets is impossible, since many do not have a clothes dryer machine. Along with this the laundry shops are far from the city blocks. Easy Laundry is an app that allows the inhabitants of the city blocks find the highest bidder for laundry. The customer all you have to do is indicate to the application that wants to wash clothes and this will send the request to laundries, so they send the customer service value, and customer can can decide whether to accept service.
